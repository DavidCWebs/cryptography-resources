Block Cipher Modes of Operation
===============================
A block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security or authenticity.

A block cipher provides secure cryptographic transformation (encryption/decryption) of a fixed-length group of bits called a block.

A block cipher mode of operation describes how to apply the single block operation to a group of blocks, securely transforming data.

Modes of Operation

* Electronic Code Book (ECB)
* Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
* Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)
* Counter Mode (CTR)
